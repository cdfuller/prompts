# Example Feature Planning Record

## Step 1: Intake Snapshot

**Problem Statement:**
Users report eye strain when using the dashboard at night and churn increases during late hours. The current UI offers no low-light option and the color palette fails accessibility contrast targets for dark environments.

**Proposed Solution (High-Level):**
Introduce a user-toggleable dark theme for the web dashboard that persists per device, automatically adjusting colors and charts to remain legible while meeting contrast requirements.

**Target Audience:**
Existing dashboard users who work after sunset, including on-call engineers and operations analysts.

**Key Constraints and Preferences:**
Must rely on existing design tokens; no new design system. Needs to work offline in the desktop app shell. Prefer pure CSS/JS implementation without adding a theming framework. Release must stay within free tier of analytics tooling.

## Step 2: Scope Check

- **Must-Have Boundaries:** Support dark theme toggle in header. Persist preference locally. Ensure top 10 screens meet contrast and readability. Out of scope: mobile native apps, email templates, theme scheduling.
- **Dependencies / Prereqs:** Need updated contrast tokens from design file. Confirm chart library supports theme switch (chart.js). Capture baseline performance metrics for repaint cost.
- **Rollout Considerations:** Soft-launch behind a feature flag, then enable for all users after monitoring crash-free sessions and feedback.
- **Effort Budget:** Two focused work blocks this week plus one cleanup session; defer if prep exceeds that.

## Step 3: Solution Sketch

- **Approach Summary:** Extend the token system with dark variants, load them via CSS variables toggled by `data-theme` attribute, and update chart configuration to read theme-aware colors. Add header toggle that writes to `localStorage` and applies on boot.
- **Key Changes / Touchpoints:** `styles/tokens.css`, `components/HeaderToggle.tsx`, `hooks/useTheme.ts`, `charts/config.ts`, feature flag config.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Potential FOUC when switching themes → preload dark CSS variables. Chart gradients may become muddy → validate with design tokens before rollout. Performance hit from re-rendering charts → batch updates and measure FPS with dev tools.
- **Test Strategy:** Manual pass across top 10 screens in both themes. Add RTL test ensuring theme persistence. Snapshot tests for key components with dark theme classes. Visual diff on dashboard via Percy.
- **Reference Links or Notes:** Design token doc v3.2, dark mode competitive analysis notes, spike branch `spike/dark-mode-toggle`.

## Step 4: Implementation Plan

- **Milestone 1:**
  - *Goal:* Extend token system with dark variants and load via CSS variables.
  - *Expected Output:* Updated `tokens.css` with `--color-*--dark` values and runtime toggle verified in Storybook.
- **Milestone 2:**
  - *Goal:* Wire up UI toggle and persistence.
  - *Expected Output:* Header toggle component with `localStorage` persistence and initial theme set on boot.
- **Milestone 3:**
  - *Goal:* Update chart theming and run quality checks.
  - *Expected Output:* Charts pulling theme-aware colors, visual diff approval, manual checklist completed.
- **Deployment & Follow-Up Tasks:** Add feature flag rollout plan, write release notes entry, monitor crash-free sessions + user feedback for 48 hours, capture retro notes on theme performance.

Coding begins after Milestone 3 plan is verified; proceed with implementation using the steps above.

## Future Considerations

- **Item:** Time-based auto dark mode (sunset scheduling).
  - **Reason:** Requires geolocation permissions and new settings UI, exceeds current effort budget.
  - **Revisit Trigger:** Reassess after monitoring dark theme adoption for one month.
- **Item:** Theming for mobile native apps.
  - **Reason:** Mobile codebase uses different styling system; needs separate spike.
  - **Revisit Trigger:** When mobile team schedules Q3 appearance refresh.
