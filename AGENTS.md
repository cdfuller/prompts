# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
All reusable prompt templates live at the repository root as Markdown files (`feature_planning_process.md`, `project_planning_process.md`, `prd_dev_process.md`). Example artifacts and walkthroughs belong in `examples/`, which mirrors the structure of the primary docs. Keep any new support files alongside related prompts so contributors can discover them quickly.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
This project is documentation-first; no compilation or packaging is required. Use `rg --files` to confirm new prompts are tracked and `rg "TODO"` before submitting to avoid lingering placeholders. When previewing Markdown, run `open <file>.md` or your editorâ€™s preview to validate headings and internal links.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Author prompts in Markdown with clear section headings (`## Step Overview`). Favor ordered lists for procedures and bullet lists for checklists. Keep filenames descriptive, lower_snake_case, and ending in `.md`. When small code snippets are necessary, format them with fenced code blocks and language hints (e.g., <code>```bash</code>). Follow the Python baseline in shared guidance: 4-space indentation, snake_case for helpers, and omit type annotations unless a prompt explicitly requires them.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no automated test suite; quality checks rely on peer review and manual walkthroughs. Before proposing changes, exercise each checklist or prompt end-to-end to confirm instructions remain coherent. Capture any assumptions or open questions in the pull request description so reviewers can validate them.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Compose single-line imperative commit messages (e.g., `Update project planning prompt`). Group related edits logically and avoid mixing structural reorganizations with content rewrites. Pull requests should describe the motivation, highlight key sections touched, and link to relevant issues or product briefs. Add before/after screenshots when visual formatting changes materially alter readability.

## Agent-Specific Instructions
Global agent prompts sit in `GLOBAL_AGENTS.md`. Developers using the Codex CLI should symlink it with ``ln -s "$(pwd)/GLOBAL_AGENTS.md" ~/.codex/AGENTS.md`` so the shared instructions load automatically. Update both `GLOBAL_AGENTS.md` and this guide whenever workflow expectations shift.
