# Prompts

This repository collects my reusable prompt templates and process docs for planning product work.

## Contents
- `feature_planning_process.md` – step-by-step guide for shaping and refining a feature plan.
- `project_planning_process.md` – workflow for turning product goals into project plans.
- `examples/feature_plan_example.md` – filled example that shows how the prompts tie together.

## How to Use
1. Pick the process that matches the task you are tackling.
2. Copy the corresponding prompt into your workspace or tooling of choice.
3. Customize the sections with the specifics of your product or feature.
4. Iterate using the checklists to make sure the plan is thorough.
